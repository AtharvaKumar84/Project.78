    <H2>The Role of Nutrition</H2>
    <P>Nutrition plays a central role in achieving and maintaining a healthy BMI. A well-balanced diet provides essential nutrients while helping to regulate calorie intake, which is crucial for weight management. Here are some key principles to keep in mind when it comes to nutrition and BMI:</P>
    <br>
    <h3>Balance Macronutrients: </h3>
    <p>Aim to include a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats in your meals. Opt for whole grains, lean proteins, and unsaturated fats while minimizing intake of refined carbohydrates and saturated fats.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Portion Control</h3>
    <p>Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and be mindful of serving sizes recommended for different food groups.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Emphasize Fruits and Vegetables: </h3>
    <p>Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber while being low in calories. Aim to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables at each meal.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Limit Added Sugars and Processed Foods</h3>
    <p>Minimize consumption of foods and beverages high in added sugars, such as sugary drinks, sweets, and processed snacks. Opt for whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Stay Hydrated:</h3>
    <p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support overall health. Limit intake of sugary beverages and opt for water, herbal teas, or infused water instead.</p>
    <br>
